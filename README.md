#Unity first person character controller
by John Bruneau.

I was frustrated that Unity's old character controller was deprecated and broken, and their new one was overly complex and missing the benefits of a rigidbody.
- I updated my jumping based on Brackeys fps controller. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QajrabyTJc)
- I added grabbing which I see as a common request in VR.

I am open to making code improvements based suggestions but the main goal here is simplicity, something my students can easily understand and use to quickly get a game started with.

Free to use. Attribution appreciated.
